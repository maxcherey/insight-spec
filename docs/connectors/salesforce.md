## Overview

**API**: Salesforce REST API + SOQL query language

**Category**: CRM

**Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 (Connected App) or username/password + security token

**Identity**: `salesforce_users.email` — internal salespeople resolved to canonical `person_id` via Identity Manager.

**Field naming**: snake_case — Salesforce API uses PascalCase (e.g. `OwnerId`, `AccountId`) but normalised to snake_case at Bronze level.

**Why multiple tables**: Same modular CRM object model as HubSpot — contacts, accounts, opportunities, activities, and users are separate Salesforce objects joined by 18-char IDs.

**Key differences from HubSpot:**

| Aspect | HubSpot | Salesforce |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Companies | Companies | Accounts |
| Deals | Deals | Opportunities |
| Activities | Engagements (unified) | Tasks + Events (separate objects) |
| User ID | `owner_id` (numeric) | `OwnerId` (18-char Salesforce ID) |
| Custom fields | Portal properties | Custom `__c` fields (schema-driven) |
| History | Separate history objects | `FieldHistory` tracking per object |

**Primary use in Insight**: linking commercial activity to salespeople (`salesforce_users`) for workload and performance analytics. Opportunities enable deal pipeline analytics.

Monitoring table — not an analytics source.

## Identity Resolution

`salesforce_users.email` is the identity key for internal users (salespeople) — resolved to canonical `person_id` via Identity Manager.

`owner_id` (18-char Salesforce ID) is used to join activities, opportunities, and accounts back to `salesforce_users` for email resolution.

`salesforce_contacts.email` is for external customers — not resolved to `person_id` (same boundary as HubSpot contacts).

## Silver / Gold Mappings

| Bronze table | Silver target | Status |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| `salesforce_users` | Identity Manager (email → `person_id`) | ✓ Used for identity resolution |
| `salesforce_opportunities` | `class_crm_deals` | Planned — CRM Silver stream not yet defined |
| `salesforce_activities` | `class_crm_activities` | Planned — CRM Silver stream not yet defined |
| `salesforce_contacts` | *(CRM reference)* | Available — external contacts, no Silver target |
| `salesforce_accounts` | *(CRM reference)* | Available — account data, no Silver target |

**Gold**: Same as HubSpot — sales performance metrics, deal pipeline analytics, workload per salesperson. The unified `class_crm_deals` and `class_crm_activities` streams will cover both HubSpot and Salesforce.

## Open Questions

### OQ-SF-1: Tasks vs Events — unified or separate Silver tables

Salesforce stores Tasks and Events as separate objects with different fields (Tasks have `status`, Events have `duration`). This spec merges them into `salesforce_activities` with nullable fields.

When building `class_crm_activities`:
- Should Tasks and Events be separate rows with nullable columns (this spec's approach)?
- Or should the Silver schema have `activity_subtype: task | event` with fully nullable non-universal fields?
- How does this map to HubSpot's unified engagement model?

### OQ-SF-2: Custom `__c` fields — collection scope

Salesforce customers heavily customise their schema with `__c` (custom) fields. The connector as specced collects standard fields only.

- Should whitelisted custom fields be collected (e.g. `Account.Contract_Value__c`)?
- If yes, should custom fields be stored in a `jsonb` catch-all column or as explicit columns per client configuration?
